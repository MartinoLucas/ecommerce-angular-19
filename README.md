## Project Overview

This ecommerce project serves as a comprehensive example to demonstrate the capabilities and features of Angular version 19.1.3. It covers various aspects of Angular development, including:

- **Component-based architecture**: Learn how to create and manage reusable components.
- **Routing and navigation**: Understand how to set up and configure routes for seamless navigation.
- **State management**: Explore techniques for managing application state using services and state management libraries.
- **Forms and validation**: Implement reactive and template-driven forms with validation.
- **HTTP client**: Interact with backend services using Angular's HTTP client module.
- **Testing**: Write and run unit and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
- **Build and deployment**: Optimize and deploy your application for production.

By working through this project, you will gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of Angular's core concepts and best practices.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
